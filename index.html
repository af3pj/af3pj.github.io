<h3>Andrew Ferguson</h3>
<p>
I'm a grad student in English at the University of Virginia, working on the texts and media of roughly the last hundred years. I'm almost done with my dissertation, which takes videogame strategies such as speedrunning and glitching and applies them to novels like <em>Pale Fire</em> and <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. I am surprisingly bad at videogames.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, I work on science fiction and genre literature. My biography of the science fiction author R.A. Lafferty is forthcoming from the University of Illinois Modern Masters of SF series, and my blog about Laffertyâ€™s works (ongoing though on brief hiatus) is at <a href="http://ralafferty.tumblr.com">Continued on Next Rock</a>. I'm also an assistant editor at <em><a href="http://www.sf-foundation.org/publications/foundation/index.html">Foundation</a></em>.
